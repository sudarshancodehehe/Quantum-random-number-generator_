# **Quantum Random Number Generation and Applications**  

This repository presents our innovative approach to **Quantum Random Number Generation (QRNG)**, highlighting its practical and creative applications. Using advanced quantum algorithms and Qiskit modules, we ensure high-quality randomness with minimal bias and classical interference.  

## **Key Features**
- **Quantum Random Number Generation:**
  - Combines **input state preparation** and **state series measurement** for robust randomness.
  - Implements techniques to reduce bias and mitigate classical correlations.  

- **Applications of Quantum Random Numbers:**
  1. **Artwork Generation:**  
     - Generates unique and unpredictable quantum-inspired patterns, showcasing the artistic potential of quantum computing.  
  2. **Pi Estimation via Monte Carlo Simulation:**  
     - Uses quantum randomness to estimate the value of Pi, demonstrating the intersection of quantum principles and classical computational methods.

## **Why This Project Stands Out**
- Integrates advanced Qiskit modules for randomness generation, optimization, and visualization.  
- Addresses challenges like bias reduction and correlation handling in random sequence generation.  
- Combines technical rigor with engaging real-world applications, offering a fresh perspective on quantum randomness.  

## **Technology Stack**
- **Quantum Computing:** Qiskit (QuantumCircuit, quantum_info, Aer, Runtime)  
- **Programming Languages:** Python  
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Qiskit visualization tools  
- **Mathematics & Simulation:** NumPy, Monte Carlo techniques
